# Debug and profile


In this section, you will learn how to debug TiDB, which is very helpful not only for debugging, but also enables you to stop TiDB at any line of code, and inspect values and stacks. You will also learn how to profile TiDB to catch the performance bottleneck.

## TL;DR

* how to use GoLand for debugging
* how to use delve for debugging from command line
* using `pprof` for profiling
* using `perf` for profiling



including but not limited to:

* how to debug tidb
* how to write benchmarks
* how to profile
